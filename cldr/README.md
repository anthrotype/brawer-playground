CLDR playground
===============

This is my playground for small to clean up various data files.
I plan contributing these files to the
[Unicode CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/) project, and these
scripts here help me ensuring that my submissions are reaonable.

To run the script on a Debian machine:
`$ sudo apt-get install libicu-dev python-pyicu
$ python check_translit_my.py`
